# Level Design
Edmund McMillen on Teaching through Game Design and Mechanics

## Teach the player how to play
You need to make sure that they understand the mechanic of the game.
Every level in the first chapter needs to have some example forcing the player to do something in order to beat the level, that they will need further in the game.

## Introduce new mechanics
Can be either change the player properties or the environment that can change the mechanics.

E.g.
Saw
- Static saw
- 2 directional moving saw
- Windmill like saw

Expanding on a simple mechanic, making it different and more enjoyable each time.

As a designer you want to explore each mechanic and can make sure it can be enjoyed at least 3 or 4 different ways.
