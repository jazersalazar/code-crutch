# Javascript Coding Standard

The value is determined by the function and will not be mutated afterwards.
```
const constCamelCase = functionNameCamelCase(parameterflatcase) { }
```

The value is hardcoded
```
const CONSTANT_SNAKE_CASE = "value";
```

```
functionNameCamelCase
variableNameCamelCase
ClassNamePascalCase
objectNameCamelCase
methodNameCamelCase
CONSTANT_SNAKE_CASE
filenameflatcase.js
